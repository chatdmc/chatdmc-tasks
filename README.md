# Take-Home Assignment - General Instructions

## Overview

This repository contains two separate take-home assignments designed to evaluate different aspects of your development skills.

## Technology Requirements

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Shadcn/ui** (latest version)

- If you need custom values, define them in your Tailwind config

### Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable code
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Next.js 15 best practices
